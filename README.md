# SwarmCD - Continuous Deployment App

SwarmCD is a lightweight Flask application that provides webhook-based automated deployments for Docker Swarm clusters. It enables seamless updates to your services when a new image is built.

## Features
- Simple and lightweight Flask application with SQLite3
- Fully containerized using Docker
- Easily deployable using `docker stack deploy`
- Webhook support for automated service updates
- Nginx integration for secure external access

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine
- An active Docker Swarm cluster

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Deployment Directory
Ensure your Swarm cluster is running. Then, create a directory (e.g., `SwarmCD`).

### 2. Create `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  flask:
    image: dockerhub.com/swarmcd:0.1
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    networks:
      - swarmcd-network

networks:
  swarmcd-network:
    driver: overlay
```

### 3. Create `.env` File
```sh
SECRET_TOKEN=ZY95q3443KvPsil  # Authentication token for webhook requests
GIT_USERNAME=username        # Docker registry username
GIT_PASSWORD=password        # Docker registry password
BROWSER_TOKEN=123456         # Token for web interface access
ROOT_PATH=/hook              # Custom path for webhooks
```

### 4. Deploy the Application
Run the following command to deploy the stack:
```sh
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml swarmcd
```

## Accessing the Web Interface
Once deployed, access the web UI to view services and images:
```
http://<swarmcd-deployed-machine-ip>:5000/hook/?token=BROWSER_TOKEN
```
This interface allows you to reload the service list when changes occur.

## Webhook Functionality
### Environment Variables Setup
```sh
export SECRET_TOKEN=ZY95q3443KvPsil
export ROOT_PATH=/hook
```

### Triggering a Deployment
To update a service with a new image, send a POST request to the webhook:
```sh
curl -X POST "http://<swarmcd-deployed-machine-ip>:5000$ROOT_PATH/" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $SECRET_TOKEN" \
    -d '{
        "project": {
            "image_name": "git.mygit.com/myapp",
            "tag_name": "latest"
        }
    }'
```

## Integrating with GitLab CI/CD
Define `SECRET_TOKEN` in your GitLab CI/CD runner variables and integrate the webhook in `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - deploy

variables:
  DOCKER_REGISTRY: "git.mygit.com:5050"
  IMAGE_NAME: "$DOCKER_REGISTRY/myapp"
  IMAGE_TAG: "latest"
  ROOT_PATH: "/hook"

before_script:
  - docker login -u "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" -p "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" "$CI_REGISTRY"

build_app:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t "$IMAGE_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG" .
    - docker push "$IMAGE_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG"
  only:
    - main

deploy_service:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - curl -X POST "http://<swarmcd-deployed-machine-ip>:5000$ROOT_PATH/" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $SECRET_TOKEN" \
        -d '{"project":{"image_name":"$IMAGE_NAME","tag_name":"$IMAGE_TAG"}}'
```

## Using Nginx as a Proxy
To expose the webhook securely, add the following configuration to your Nginx `server` block:

```nginx
location /hook/ {
    proxy_pass http://<swarmcd-deployed-machine-ip>:5000/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

### Accessing via Nginx
```
https://project.com/hook/?token=BROWSER_TOKEN
```

### Webhook Usage via Nginx
```sh
curl -X POST "https://project.com/hook/" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $SECRET_TOKEN" \
    -d '{
        "project": {
            "image_name": "git.mygit.com/myapp",
            "tag_name": "latest"
        }
    }'
```
